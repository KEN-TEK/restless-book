      <p>BEYOND BORDERS
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND THE VALUE OF 
UNITY.</p>

      <p>To be an international student is to live between worlds. It 
means carrying the culture of one’s homeland while adapting 
to the rhythms of a foreign land, balancing hope with 
uncertainty, and learning to walk the delicate line between 
belonging and isolation. International students are not merely 
learners of academic subjects but also apprentices of life, 
discovering resilience, patience, and courage far from home.</p>

      <p>Just as St. Augustine, in Confessions, recalls receiving 
support to pursue his studies in Carthage, Tunisia, so too are 
many international students today granted scholarships that 
carry them beyond the borders of their birthplaces. They leave 
behind families, friends, and cherished traditions, stepping 
into an unfamiliar future filled with both promise and 
challenge.</p>

      <p>At first glance, one might believe that success rests solely on 
personal effort, moving swiftly through studies, adapting 
rapidly to new cultures, and chasing ambitions with 
determination. Yet, as Augustine’s own journey reveals, 
brilliance alone cannot sustain someone for long. To go far 
requires the strength of community, the wisdom of mentors, 
and the companionship of trusted friends.</p>

      <p>In the same way, international students thrive when they 
cultivate networks of support from fellow scholars to 
hospitable host communities. Their success is measured not 
only by academic triumphs but also by the depth of 
relationships that sustain them. This truth echoes the enduring 
wisdom of the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go 
alone. If you want to go far, go together.”</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>THE POWER OF BELONGING.</h2>

      <p>In August 2024, a young Ugandan student applied for a
government scholarship. Like many of his peers, he 
dreamed of new horizons of pursuing knowledge abroad 
and of building a future that would honour both his family 
and his country. When the scholarship was granted, his joy 
was profound, and he began preparing for the journey 
ahead. His destination was Algeria, a land he had never 
known, but one that now carried the promise of education, 
opportunity and growth. By the end of November 2024, he 
had set foot in the Wilaya of Jijel, ready to begin his studies 
at Jijel University.</p>

      <p>Yet this story did not begin in Algeria. Even in his high school 
days in Uganda, he was known for his solitary ways. While 
others socialized freely, he preferred to work alone. He 
studied in silence, avoided unnecessary interactions, and kept 
his circle small. To some, his behaviour looked like discipline; 
to others, it seemed like pride. But to him, it was survival. He 
had long believed that walking alone was faster and that 
independence was the true key to success. This mindset 
crossed borders with him. Algeria did not change his habits; 
instead, it became the stage where his solitude would reveal 
its cost.</p>

      <p>For months after his arrival, he lived as he always had. He 
attended lectures and fulfilled academic requirements, but 
never truly entered the circle of student life. He isolated 
himself, keeping his distance from peers and ignoring the 
vibrant community that surrounded him. His room became his 
fortress, and silence his closest companion. What he thought 
was strength was, in truth, eroding his spirit. As St. Augustine 
once wrote in Confessions, “There is no greater misfortune 
than to be without friends.” That truth was already etched into 
his life, though he did not yet recognize it.</p>

      <p>By June 2025, the burden of loneliness had grown unbearable. 
One evening, without warning, he left his room wide open, 
abandoned his belongings, including his phone and 
disappeared. The silence of his absence sent ripples through 
the student community. When he did not return by nightfall, 
concern spread. By the next day, alarm gripped the campus. 
Three days would pass before he was found, but in those three 
days an extraordinary lesson unfolded: the power of belonging.</p>

      <p>On the very first day, the search began. Calls were made to the 
local police, and official reports were filed. His fellow 
Ugandans contacted the embassy and the Education Attaché,
ensuring that his disappearance was treated with urgency. Yet 
the effort did not end there. Students in Jijel reached out to 
international student communities in universities across 
Algeria. Messages spread, photographs circulated, and 
networks came alive. What had once been a private struggle 
became a shared responsibility.</p>

      <p>The police in Jijel mobilized patrols, combing streets, 
questioning townspeople and checking common gathering 
places. Meanwhile, students organized themselves into 
search groups, walking through neighbourhoods, bus stations, 
and markets, leaving no lead unexplored. Their determination 
echoed Augustine’s wisdom: “Two are better than one, for if 
they fall, one will lift up the other.” The student had fallen, but 
now a whole community was striving to lift him up.</p>

      <p>The second day brought no breakthrough, yet it did not weaken 
their resolve. The embassy urged persistence, the Education 
Attaché coordinated efforts with authorities, and the 
international student community refused to give up. Fear 
lingered, but unity overcame it. They understood that beyond 
borders and differences, they were bound by something 
greater; the responsibility of belonging to one another.</p>

      <p>On the third day, the breakthrough finally came. The missing 
student was discovered in the town of Jijel, sitting alone, 
weary, and disoriented. Hunger had drained his strength, and 
despair had clouded his mind. He had withdrawn so deeply 
into himself that he was stranded in both body and spirit. Yet 
when he was found, there was no anger, no rebuke—only 
relief.</p>

      <p>When news of his recovery spread, the students could not 
contain their joy. Their faces radiated with indescribable 
happiness. Some laughed through their tears, others 
embraced him tightly, unwilling to let go. A few broke down 
completely, weeping with relief and gratitude. Their joy was 
not only because he was alive, but also because their 
collective efforts, their sleepless nights, their prayers, and 
their unity had not been in vain.</p>

      <p>He was given food, rest, and medical care, and gradually his 
strength returned. Before the Education Attaché and the boy 
departed for Uganda, a warm dinner was organized at Jijel. The
Education Attaché dined with the Ugandan students there, 
together with other students who had travelled from Bejaïa to 
support the search. The gathering turned into a memorable 
celebration of solidarity, resilience and the enduring bonds of 
community.</p>

      <p>His disappearance was tragic, but his rescue was a testimony. 
He had believed that solitude was the way forward, that 
independence was the path to success. Yet his collapse 
revealed the opposite: isolation had weakened him, while 
community had saved him. Augustine himself knew this truth 
well, writing, “We are bound to one another by the bond of 
love, and without love no one truly lives.” The student’s life 
was preserved not by his own efforts, but by the love and unity 
of others.</p>

      <p>The lesson is clear. While solitude promises speed, it rarely 
grants endurance. Belonging, on the other hand, sustains, 
restores and carries us further than we could ever go alone. 
The African proverb rings true: “If you want to go fast, go alone. 
If you want to go far, go together.” The young Ugandan’s story 
in Algeria is a living parable that the power of belonging 
transcends borders, languages and nations, and it is this 
belonging that makes survival, growth and flourishing possible.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>FROM CRISIS TO VISION.</h2>

      <p>The disappearance of a young Ugandan student in June 
2025 shook the international student community in Algeria 
to its very core. For three long days, fear and uncertainty 
weighed heavily upon them, until his eventual rescue 
brought immense relief and deep reflection. Yet the story 
did not end with his safe return to Uganda, it became a 
mirror that forced everyone to confront the fragility of 
isolation and the necessity of unity.</p>

      <p>In that very moment, Mr. John Bosco Tumusiime chose to 
act. He refused to allow the memory of June to fade into 
silence. Instead, he embraced it as a sign: students 
abroad need more than lectures and certificates; they 
need a genuine sense of belonging. What had once been a 
quiet dream conceived months before was now brought 
boldly into the open. Thus, in June 2025, Mr. John Bosco 
unveiled the Know Your Neighbour Initiative to the public.</p>

      <p>His decision was not an escape from the past but rather a 
transformation of pain into purpose. As Friedrich 
Nietzsche once wrote, “He who has a why to live can bear 
almost any how.” Mr. Bosco discovered his why: to ensure 
that no student would ever again feel abandoned in 
loneliness.</p>

      <p>Compelled by love for others and inspired by the desire to 
strengthen bonds of friendship between Uganda and 
Algeria, Bosco allowed crisis to give birth to vision. The 
incident did not remain a scar but became a seed, one 
that blossomed into the Know Your Neighbour Initiative, a 
living reminder that solidarity can turn fear into hope, and 
strangers into family.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>The Genesis of Know Your Neighbour Initiative.</h2>

      <p>On 16th November 2024, during Marhaba Day in Algeria, Mr. John 
Bosco Tumusiime noticed with quiet concern that his beloved 
country, Uganda, had no voice on the official programme. Guided 
by humility and courage, he approached the organisers—among 
them Mr. Mohamed Benmounemene Salim, a distinguished 
professor and journalist—and respectfully requested a chance to 
speak. His request was warmly received, and when he finally 
stood before the gathering, he spoke with grace and conviction.</p>

      <p>His words painted a vivid picture of Uganda, the Pearl of Africa—a 
land blessed with majestic beauty, vibrant culture, and a people 
bound by warmth and unity. The audience listened intently, 
captivated by his passion and sincerity. Through televised 
coverage, his message reached far beyond the hall, touching 
hearts across Algeria and other parts of Africa. In that moment, 
the seed of what would become the Know Your Neighbour 
Initiative was quietly planted in fertile ground.</p>

      <p>At first, Mr. John Bosco carried this vision in solitude. The dream 
was radiant in his heart, yet the road was lonely and heavy. But 
within that solitude, a truth echoed—a timeless proverb that 
would become the foundation of his journey: “If you want to go
fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”</p>

      <p>As President of the Peace Campus Ambassadors at the University 
of Khemis Miliana, he was determined to transform ideals into 
impact. Working closely with the organisation, which has offices 
in Algeria, he began translating compassion into meaningful 
action. The Peace Campus Ambassadors occasionally extended 
financial support, and Mr. John Bosco, together with his 
colleagues, Mr. Rogers Kawenja, Mukisa Emmanuel, and Mr.
Zziwa Charles, added their own contributions. With hearts full of 
generosity, they reached out to those in need within Aïn Defla, 
offering essentials, comfort, and above all, human connection.</p>

      <p>It was not merely the act of giving that defined their work, but the 
spirit behind it—the empathy, solidarity, and dignity they offered 
to each person they encountered. These moments breathed life 
into the emerging Know Your Neighbour Initiative, transforming it 
from an idea into a living movement grounded in compassion. 
From that day onward, Mr. John Bosco was no longer walking 
alone; he had found companions who shared both his vision and 
his heart.</p>

      <p>Word of their efforts soon spread across Algeria. Ugandan 
students from Blida, Boumerdès, Constantine, Bejaïa, Tlemcen, 
Skikda, Batna, Algiers, Oran, Médea Djelfa, Laghouat, and 
Annaba joined hands with their Algerian counterparts at Khemis 
Miliana. Together they formed a network of friendship that 
transcended language, nationality, and culture. They became a
living proof that unity is not built by proximity, but by purpose; 
that neighbours are not defined by borders, but by shared 
humanity.</p>

      <p>Through their collaboration, Uganda’s name shone brightly 
abroad. Their actions reflected the soul of Ugandans—
welcoming, resilient, cooperative, and ever ready to lift others. 
They became ambassadors of friendship, inviting Algerians and 
other international students to discover not just Uganda’s scenic 
landscapes, but the spirit of its people.</p>

      <p>In June 2025, their unity faced a severe test. The sudden 
disappearance of a Ugandan student cast a shadow of fear over 
the international community. For three days, anxiety gripped 
every heart. Yet, from that darkness emerged an extraordinary 
light—the light of solidarity. Students, embassy officials, and 
Algerian authorities worked tirelessly together until the student 
was found safe. That moment of relief was not merely a rescue; it 
was a revelation. It reminded everyone that in times of 
uncertainty, survival is never the triumph of one, but the victory of 
many standing side by side.</p>

      <p>Following this event, Mr. John Bosco Tumusiime decided to make 
the Know Your Neighbour Initiative publicly known. He realized 
that the same unity which had saved a life could also nurture a 
stronger and more connected community. By officially presenting 
the initiative to the public, he opened the door for other 
international students to join hands in a shared spirit of solidarity 
and friendship. His decision marked a turning point— 
transforming what had begun as a quiet effort of goodwill into a 
growing movement of cooperation and mutual support. From that 
moment, students from various countries were inspired to take 
part, united by the vision of standing together as one community.</p>

      <p>In the months that followed, the initiative grew in strength and 
clarity. On 30th September, 2025, Ugandan students in Algiers 
met with Ambassador Dr. Julius Joshua Kivuna, the Deputy Head 
of Mission, in the presence of Mr. Mohamed Benmounemene 
Salim. The meeting celebrated not only the birth of an idea but the 
perseverance of a dream. Both leaders commended the students 
for their commitment to peace, cooperation, and cultural 
understanding, and encouraged them to continue serving as a 
bridge between Uganda and Algeria.</p>

      <p>Today, the Know Your Neighbour Initiative patiently awaits formal 
recognition from the Algerian government. Yet, its spirit already 
thrives—in every act of kindness, in every partnership formed, 
and in every friendship nurtured across campuses. Its essence
cannot be contained by paperwork or titles, for it lives in the 
hearts of those who believe that unity is the highest form of 
strength.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>The Goals of the Initiative.</h2>

      <p>To understand the heartbeat of this association, it is important 
to look at its core objective, the guiding lights that define it’s 
mission and inspire its actions. The Know Your Neighbour 
Initiative is the Ugandan students in Algeria working hand in hand 
with Algerian and international peers through the following five 
core objectives.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Promote Uganda’s Tourism and Culture.</strong><br>
<strong>2. Strengthen Youth Engagement through Sports and Recreation.</strong><br>
<strong>3. Build Meaningful Friendships through Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing.</strong><br>
<strong>4. Carry Out Acts of Compassion and Solidarity.</strong><br>
<strong>5. Promote Trade and Investment.</strong></p>

      <p>Beyond being written statements, these objectives represent real 
action, lived experience and a shared commitment among all 
participants. The following explanations highlight their true 
essence</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>1. Promoting Uganda’s Tourism and Culture:</h2>

      <p>The initiative seeks to showcase the beauty and diversity of 
Uganda through cultural nights, exhibitions, and festivals. 
These events allow Ugandan students in Algeria shares its
heritage—through landscapes, cuisine, music, and dance— 
becoming ambassadors of their country while inspiring 
curiosity and friendship among Algerian communities.</p>

      <p>In the spirit of St. Augustine’s Confessions, we are reminded that 
“the world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one 
page.” Through cultural exchange and exploration, both nations 
continue to write new pages of mutual understanding and 
appreciation.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>2. Strengthening Youth Engagement through Sports and Recreation:</h2>

      <p>Sports have proven to be a powerful instrument of unity. 
Friendly football matches have already been held between 
Ugandan and Algerian students, creating moments that 
transcend competition to symbolise cooperation, respect, 
and shared joy.</p>

      <p>Through the support of the Peace Campus Ambassadors, the 
initiative has so far been able to organise two friendly football 
tournaments between international students and Algerian 
students. The international participants came from Nigeria, Niger, 
Palestine, Mali, Mauritania, and Uganda. Though friendly, the 
matches were filled with passion and harmony. Trophies and 
medals were awarded to the best players, celebrating teamwork, 
discipline, and cross-cultural friendship.</p>

      <p>As St. Augustine reminds us, “We learn better in friendship than 
in fear.” On the field, these friendships are strengthened, and 
every match becomes a bridge between nations.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>3. Building Meaningful Friendships through Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing:</h2>

      <p>Dialogue lies at the very heart of the Know Your Neighbour 
Initiative. Through shared meals, conversations, and 
storytelling, students learn to understand and respect one 
another. The football tournaments also became rich spaces for 
dialogue, where participants from Uganda, Algeria, Nigeria, 
Niger, Palestine, Mali, and Mauritania interacted, shared 
knowledge, and exchanged ideas.</p>

      <p>Such interactions go beyond words—they create trust, inspire 
empathy, and nurture wisdom. As St. Augustine’s Confessions 
teach us, “When we speak and listen with love, we build the city 
of God even among men.” Dialogue and knowledge sharing have 
therefore turned strangers into friends, and friends into family.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>4. Carrying Out Acts of Compassion and Solidarity:</h2>

      <p>The initiative is deeply rooted in compassion and mutual 
care. It strives to ensure that no student walks alone in 
times of need—whether in moments of illness, financial 
struggle, or emotional hardship. Members have consistently 
supported one another with generosity, kindness, and 
presence.</p>

      <p>St. Augustine beautifully wrote, “Love has hands to help others, 
feet to hasten to the poor and needy, and eyes to see misery and 
want.” Compassion, when lived out in action, strengthens the 
bonds of community and reveals that kindness is the purest form 
of humanity.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>5. Promoting Trade and Investment:</h2>

      <p>The initiative also aims to strengthen economic ties and 
entrepreneurship between Uganda and Algeria. Through 
exhibitions, discussions, and collaborations, it envisions 
opportunities where Ugandan coffee, crafts, and 
innovations meet Algerian enterprise and curiosity.</p>

      <p>In the words of St. Augustine, “Good works are stronger when 
done together.” Trade and investment, when guided by integrity 
and cooperation, become more than transactions—they become 
partnerships of shared prosperity and lasting friendship.</p>

      <hr class="gold-hr" />
      <h2>THE INITIATIVE IN MOTION</h2>

      <p>The Know Your Neighbour Initiative remains in its early stages, 
yet the progress it has made reflects extraordinary cooperation 
and determination. It began with Mr. John Bosco Tumusiime, 
whose vision found its first and strongest support from Mr. Salim 
Bin, an Algerian professor and journalist, who offered him the 
opportunity to deliver his first speech on 16th November, 2024, 
during Marhaba Day. As a journalist, Mr. Salim Bin further 
supported the initiative by publishing Mr. Tumusiime’s speeches, 
allowing his message to reach audiences across Algeria and 
beyond.</p>

      <p>From there, the movement continued to grow. The Peace 
Campus Ambassadors provided generous financial and moral 
support, turning ideas into visible action. Fellow students, 
international participants, Algerian friends, and even the 
Embassy later joined in, each contributing in their own way to 
strengthen and expand the vision.</p>

      <p>Today, stands as a living testimony that true progress is never 
born of isolation. One person took the first step, but it was the 
community that carried the vision forward—proving that unity, 
shared purpose, and faith can transform a single dream into a 
movement of lasting impact</p>
